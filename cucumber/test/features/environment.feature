Feature: Environment
  In order to use the enviroment variables
  Programmers must be able to write and read environment variables

  Scenario: Write then read
    Given that I start the test
    When I set the variable as "environment" into the environment
    # Comment! =)
    Then the variable should have "environment" on its content

  Scenario: E-mail variables
    When I set the  as e-mail marcotmarcot@gmail.com into the environment
    Then the  should have e-mail marcotmarcot@gmail.com on its content
