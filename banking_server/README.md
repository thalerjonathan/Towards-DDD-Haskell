  - Put interpreters in mock module, bcs its a mock
  - test application layer
  - test domain layer

- experiment on Domain Models
  - refactor Anemic Banking Application service: this doesn't have to be that bad
  - Try different domain/application layer implementations: tagless final, reader io, freer monads
